# SnappyGit

SnappyGit is a powerful tool that enables users to create real backdated commits on their GitHub repositories. Unlike simple visual hacks or tools that just update the README file to fake contribution activity, SnappyGit does NOT just update README or any single file. Instead, it pushes actual commits with backdated timestamps across your repository, making your GitHub contribution graph authentically green.

## Features
- Select from your existing repositories added to the platform
- Create commits on any past date you choose
- Push real commits to GitHub â€” not just a visual trick
- Your contribution chart updates authentically with these commits
- Easy-to-use interface for commit generation and repository selection
